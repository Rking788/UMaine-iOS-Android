     whose private key is held by the application's developer.
  b. If you are using Eclipse with the ADT plugin, you can use the 
     Export Wizard to export a signed .apk (and even create a new keystore, 
	 if necessary).
  c. To create a signed and aligned .apk in Eclipse: 
     Select the project in the Package Explorer and select File > Export.
	 Follow the wizard.
